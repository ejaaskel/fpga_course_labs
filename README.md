FPGA course labs

Example solutions to labs 4-7 from Jordan Christman's course Learn VHDL and FPGA Development:
https://www.udemy.com/course/vhdl-and-fpga-development-for-beginners-and-intermediates/

Tested on BASYS3 board. 

Lab6 displays results of multiplication on the seven-seg display, and lab7 adjusts led brightness instead of controlling the servo (I didn't have level shifter when doing the course).

Mostly here for future reference in case I ever need a refresher of VHDL and also perhaps to help out other people doing the course. I can't guarantee that these are optimal or correct solutions because I don't know VHDL well enough to know what would be "optimal" or "correct".
